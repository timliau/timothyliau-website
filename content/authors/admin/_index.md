🙇🏻‍♂️Hi! I'm currently a student at Singapore Polytechnic majoring in Computer Engineering. I enjoy building and researching impactful tools, especially in relation to understanding how people connect, share, understand, and care about each other's emotions. 

👨🏻‍💻I currently interning in a product management role at Safe Space, a Mental Health Tech Startup based in Singapore that makes therapy more accessible.

🙌I advocate for student emotional and mental health and founded a platform to help people better cope with stress, make psychology more accessible through educational content, and create safe communities. 

📖I'm working with my school’s education department to implement a curriculum that teaches students to develop emotional management skills and practice empathy to combat bullying and its effects on victims.
